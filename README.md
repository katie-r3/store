Rails store application.

Created using:

* Rails 5.1.4

* Ruby 2.4

* Redis

* MySql

* Stripe (for receiving payments) - to run a mock payment, enter '4242 4242 4242 4242' and any future expiration date and 3 digit security code you like.

Some future fixes/ideas:

* Styling could be better

* Add sales tax, and the ability for users to enter their address. Right now they just buy items and that's the end

* Possibly add the ability for users to leave ratings about the items, not just reviews
