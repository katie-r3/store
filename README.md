Rails store application.

Created using:

* Rails 5.1.4

* Ruby 2.4

* Redis

* Stripe (for receiving payments)

* MySql

Some future fixes:

* User cannot add more than one of each item to their cart

* Cart doesn't currently empty once user pays

* ...

* Possibly add the ability for users to leave comments about the items, or ratings
